Tips and tricks:
- There is too much content and it is an open book, you should study although is an open book
- The exam is completely different from what is taught in lectures, so ask for the pdf to the natives with all past exams and study from there
- Exercise session without further ado
- Theoretical questions are in-depth so underestand the topics
- Not needed all the previous knowledge stated in the syllabus and course text, all that mathematics and stuff
