Tips and tricks:
- Lectures are usefull, try to stay up to date with lectures and topics
- Labs besides the one related with the project are not that important
- Do not let project to last minute, start soon and get good grade
- Exam as always look at old exams and their solutions from the natives and vtk
- Will not upload the project for respect, once they change it I will do
- Mandatory readings can help but did not read any
