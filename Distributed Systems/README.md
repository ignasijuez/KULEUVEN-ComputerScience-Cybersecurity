Tips and tricks:
- There is too much slides, be sure to catch the important
- Start the labs asap and ask the assistants in the labs, get good grade there will help
- Understand what you do on labs because at the end there is a defense, not code at all but the purpose of the implementations
- Recomendation to do the optional lab since you can skip one question on the final exam
- As always ask for past exams and solutions to the natives or vtk
- Will not post the solutions to the labs until ratakes end
